## Scope

The following features of the Papa John's website will be tested:
- **Login/Signup** functionality.
- **Search** for pizzas and other products.
- **Add to cart** and checkout process.
- **Payment gateway integration** (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
- **Mobile and Desktop responsiveness**.
- **Security** for data protection and payment transactions.
- **Performance** under high load.

Testing will be conducted across different browsers and devices, including desktop, mobile, and tablet platforms.

The types of testing will include:
- Functional testing
- Usability testing
- Compatibility testing (browser/device compatibility)
- Performance testing
- Security testing

## Inclusions

The following modules will be tested:
- **Login Page**: Testing the functionality of the login and signup forms.
- **Home Page**: Verifying that the homepage loads correctly and includes key features.
- **Product Search**: Verifying the accuracy of search results based on the user query.
- **Cart and Checkout**: Ensuring that products can be added to the cart and the checkout process works seamlessly.
- **Payment Gateway**: Verifying that multiple payment options work correctly.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the website is optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Security Features**: Verifying encryption and secure payment processing.

## Exclusions

The following areas will not be included in the scope of this testing:
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin functionalities will not be tested.
- **Support Pages**: These pages and any related customer service features will not be tested.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Any third-party APIs beyond the payment gateway will not be covered.

## Test Environments

Testing will be performed across multiple environments:

| Environment Type   | URL               |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| QA                 | qa.papajohns.com  |
| Pre-Production     | preprod.papajohns.com |
| User Acceptance Testing (UAT) | uat.papajohns.com |
| Production         | www.papajohns.com |

Supported Operating Systems:
- Windows 10
- macOS
- Android OS (for mobile)
- iOS (for mobile)

Supported Browsers:
- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)

Device Types:
- Desktop
- Laptop
- Tablet
- Mobile (Android and iOS)

## Defect Reporting Procedure

Defects will be reported using **JIRA**. The defect reporting procedure is as follows:
1. **Identification**: Identify the issue based on the test case failure or anomaly.
2. **Documenting**: Log the defect in JIRA, including the following:
   - Clear description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the defect.
   - Screenshots or logs (if necessary).
3. **Triaging**: Assign the defect a severity level (critical, major, minor) and prioritize it for resolution.
4. **Resolution**: The development team will investigate and resolve the defect.
5. **Verification**: After the defect is fixed, the testing team will verify the resolution and close the defect.

## Test Strategy

Our test strategy involves the following:
1. **Test Case Creation**: Develop test cases based on the business requirements and technical specifications.
2. **Smoke Testing**: Perform initial smoke tests to ensure basic functionality is working before detailed testing begins.
3. **Test Execution**: Execute test cases across multiple environments and devices.
4. **Defect Management**: Log and track defects using JIRA. Continuous communication with the development team will be maintained for timely resolution.
5. **Regression Testing**: Conduct regression testing to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
6. **Performance and Load Testing**: Conduct stress and load testing to assess how the website handles high traffic.
7. **Security Testing**: Verify encryption, secure payment processing, and user data protection.

Test cases will follow techniques such as:
- **Equivalence Class Partitioning**
- **Boundary Value Analysis**
- **State Transition Testing**
- **Decision Table Testing**

## Test Schedule

The test schedule for the project is as follows:

| Task                         | Dates               | Duration   |
|------------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Test Plan Creation            | March 1 - March 3   | 3 days     |
| Test Case Creation            | March 4 - March 7   | 4 days     |
| Test Case Execution           | March 8 - March 14  | 7 days     |
| Test Report Generation        | March 15            | 1 day      |
| Bug Fix Verification & Retesting | March 16 - March 18 | 3 days     |

## Test Deliverables

- **Test Plan**: Document detailing the scope, objectives, and approach of testing.
- **Test Cases**: A suite of test cases covering all requirements.
- **Test Reports**: Reports on test case execution and defect statuses.
- **Defect Logs**: Logs of all identified defects and their resolution status.
- **Final Test Summary Report**: A comprehensive summary of the testing activities and results.

## Entry and Exit Criteria

### Test Execution Entry Criteria:
- Test Scenarios and Test Cases must be signed off by the client.
- The application must be ready for testing.

### Test Execution Exit Criteria:
- All test cases must be executed and results documented.
- Defect reports must be ready for review.
- All critical defects must be resolved.

### Test Closure Entry Criteria:
- Test case execution and defect resolution reports are ready.
- The application is stable and all major functionality has been verified.

### Test Closure Exit Criteria:
- Test Summary Report must be submitted to the client.
- Test completion sign-off from the project team.

## Tools

The following tools will be used for testing:
- **JIRA**: For bug tracking and defect management.
- **Selenium**: For automated testing.
- **Postman**: For API testing.
- **BrowserStack**: For cross-browser and cross-device testing.
- **TestRail**: For test case management.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Delay in Test Environment Setup
- **Mitigation**: Early coordination with the IT team to ensure timely availability of test environments.

### Risk: Insufficient Test Data
- **Mitigation**: Use mock data for testing or collaborate with the development team to generate necessary test data.

### Risk: Resource Constraints
- **Mitigation**: Ensure adequate resource allocation and prioritize critical test cases.

## Approvals

The following documents will be sent for client approval:
