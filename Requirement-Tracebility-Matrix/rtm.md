# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) for Papa John's Website Testing

This document outlines the **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** for the **Papa John's Website Testing** project. The RTM links the business requirements, technical requirements, and test cases to ensure full test coverage and traceability throughout the testing process.

## Purpose of the RTM

The **RTM** serves to:

- **Ensure complete test coverage**: Every requirement is linked to specific test cases to verify that the feature works as expected.
- **Maintain traceability**: It ensures that all requirements are being tested, and the relationship between requirements and test cases is clear.
- **Track progress**: Helps in tracking the execution of tests against each requirement and helps identify any gaps in test coverage.

## RTM Overview

The **RTM** contains the following columns:

- **Traceability #**: A unique identifier for each requirement.
- **Requirement ID**: The ID of the business requirement.
- **Technical Requirement ID**: The ID of the technical component that supports the business requirement.
- **Test Case ID**: The specific test case ID that validates the requirement.

## RTM Table

| Traceability # | Requirement ID | Technical Requirement ID | Test Case ID |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| a              | R1             | T1                        | TC-001      |
| b              | R2             | T2                        | TC-002      |
| c              | R3             | T3                        | TC-003      |
| d              | R4             | T4                        | TC-004      |
| e              | R5             | T5                        | TC-005      |
| f              | R6             | T6                        | TC-006      |

### Explanation of the Columns:

- **Traceability #**: A unique reference number assigned to each row in the matrix for easy identification.
- **Requirement ID**:
  - **R1**: The website should allow users to log in with valid credentials.
  - **R2**: Users should be able to search for pizzas and view details.
  - **R3**: Users should be able to add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.
  - **R4**: The website must integrate a payment gateway with multiple payment methods.
  - **R5**: The website must be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.
  - **R6**: The website should perform well under high traffic conditions.
- **Technical Requirement ID**: Represents the underlying technical components or features that support the business requirement. These are the backend systems or technical aspects of the website that facilitate each requirement.
  - **T1**: Login functionality.
  - **T2**: Search functionality.
  - **T3**: Cart and checkout functionality.
  - **T4**: Payment gateway integration.
  - **T5**: Responsiveness of the website.
  - **T6**: Performance under load.
- **Test Case ID**: Links each requirement to the specific test case that validates it. Test cases ensure the system functions as required.
  - **TC-001**: Verify user login functionality.
  - **TC-002**: Verify search functionality for pizzas.
  - **TC-003**: Verify add-to-cart and checkout process.
  - **TC-004**: Verify payment gateway integration.
  - **TC-005**: Verify responsiveness on different devices.
  - **TC-006**: Verify performance under high load conditions.

## How to Use the RTM

1. **Review Requirements**: Begin by reviewing the business requirements and technical specifications.
2. **Link Test Cases**: Create test cases for each requirement and link them to the appropriate requirement and technical specification.
3. **Traceability**: Ensure each requirement has corresponding test cases, and every test case can be traced back to the original requirement.
4. **Execution Tracking**: During testing, use the RTM to track the execution of each test case and ensure all requirements are covered.

## Conclusion

The **RTM** is an essential tool for ensuring complete test coverage and providing traceability from the business requirements down to the specific test cases. It ensures that the Papa John's website is thoroughly tested and all features function as expected.
